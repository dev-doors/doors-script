## 🛡️ Tips for Safer Use

Account safety is paramount. Follow these guidelines strictly:

### ✅ DO's:

1. **Always Enable Anti-Ban Protection**
   - Never disable anti-ban features
   - Keep **best doors script 2025** updates current
   - Roblox anti-cheat evolves constantly

2. **Use Reasonable Automation Levels**
   ```
   Safe Configuration:
   - Auto Win Speed: Normal (not Instant)
   - Badge Collection: Gradual (not All-at-once)
   - Achievement Completion: Spread over sessions
   - Admin Panel: Minimal usage
   - Anti-Ban: ALWAYS ENABLED
   ```

3. **Mix Manual & Automated Gameplay**
   - Play 2-3 hours daily manually
   - Use **auto win doors script** for 4-6 hours during off-times
   - Vary your playstyle and room selection
   - Never farm exact same route repetitively

4. **Monitor Your Account**
   - Check Roblox login history weekly
   - Enable two-factor authentication
   - Use unique 20+ character passwords
   - Never share account credentials

5. **Stay Updated**
   - Download **doors script download** updates immediately
   - Join Discord for patch announcements
   - Monitor Roblox forums for ban waves
   - Adjust settings when game updates

6. **Practice Moderation**
   ```
   Safe Daily Usage:
   - Unlock 5-10 badges per day (not all 47 at once)
   - Complete 3-5 achievements per session
   - Run 10-15 auto wins daily (not 100+)
   - Minimize admin panel usage
   ```

### ❌ DON'Ts:

1. **Never Run Multiple Bots**
   - Multiple scripts on same account = instant permanent ban
   - Each account = 1 script instance maximum
   - Simultaneous running on 2+ accounts = immediate detection

2. **Avoid Impossible Performance**
   - Don't unlock all 47 badges in 1 minute (humans need hours)
   - Don't achieve 100% perfect runs (humans fail 5-10% of times)
   - Don't complete Doors in under 30 minutes (human record is 45+ minutes)
   - Don't access admin panel constantly—it's suspicious

3. **Never Use Outdated Versions**
   - Old **roblox doors script** versions trigger anti-cheat
   - Always use latest **best doors script** release
   - Never trust archived or community-modified code

4. **Don't Brag or Stream**
   - Never show **doors script esp** or achievements on stream
   - Don't discuss script features in-game chat
   - Don't post suspicious completion screenshots
   - Don't reveal script details on social media

5. **Avoid Extreme Stat Abnormalities**
   - Don't have 10,000% damage output (humans max ~300%)
   - Don't have impossible cosmetics
   - Don't have stats impossible for account age
   - Keep performance within 400% of human average

6. **Never Trust Suspicious Sources**
   - Only download from official GitHub
   - Avoid random Discord links claiming "leaked versions"
   - Ignore "updated scripts" from unknown sources
   - Malware-infected versions = instant account compromise

### 🔐 Advanced Security Practices:

**Use Secondary Account** (Professionals Only):
Create alternate account for testing. Isolates risk from main account during beta phases.

**Behavioral Variation Strategy**:
```
Session 1: Manual gameplay (establish human baseline)
Session 2: Auto Win enabled (medium automation)
Session 3: Badge collection (passive activity)
Session 4: Achievement completion (active grinding)
Session 5: Rest period (prevent pattern recognition)
```

**Account Staging Timeline**:
- Week 1: Manual gameplay only (establish legitimacy)
- Week 2: Enable auto win (low risk)
- Week 3: Add badge collection (medium risk)
- Week 4+: Full features (highest risk—max anti-ban)

**Monthly Forum Monitoring**:
Follow Roblox announcements for anti-cheat updates. When ban waves occur, communities share patterns. Adjust script preemptively.
